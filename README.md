airgraph-ng - a 802.11 visualization utility

SYNOPSIS:

       airgraph-ng [options]

DESCRIPITION:



       airgraph-ng  graphs  the  CSV  file generated by Airodump-ng. The idea is
       that we are showing the relationships of the clients to the AP's so don't
       be  shocked if you see only one mapping as you may only have captured one
       client

OPTIONS:


       -h     Shows the help screen.

       -i     Airodump-ng CSV file

       -o     Output png file.

       -g     Choose the Graph Type. Current types are [CAPR (Client to AP Rela‚Äê
              tionship) & CPG (Common probe graph)].

       -a     Print the about.

EXAMPLES:


       airgraph-ng -i dump-01.csv -o dump.png -g CAPR

       airgraph-ng -i dump-01.csv -o dump.png -g CPG
